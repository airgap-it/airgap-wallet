# AirGap.it wallet

An Ionic app to prepare and broadcast signed transaction to the network. This app will never come in touch with your private key. Those are securily managed in the **AirGap Vault** app. Because the phones are never physically connected to each other, we call our system AirGap.

# Prerequisite

`npm install -g cordova`
